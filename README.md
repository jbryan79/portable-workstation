## 🎯 THE STRATEGY

### **Two-Page Funnel System:**

```
Google Search: "UGREEN vs Anker"
         ↓
Comparison Page (builds trust)
         ↓
"See My Complete UGREEN Setup" CTA
         ↓
Main Showcase Page (converts)
         ↓
Amazon Affiliate Link (commission)
```

### **Why This Works:**

1. **Comparison page** = Credibility
   - Honest, data-driven
   - Both brands get wins
   - You appear trustworthy

2. **Warm Traffic** = Higher Conversion
   - Reader is pre-sold on UGREEN
   - Just needs final push
   - Your showcase provides that push

3. **Two Different Search Intents**
   - Comparison: "I'm researching"
   - Showcase: "I want UGREEN specifically"
   - You capture both audiences
